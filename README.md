# rui-webgl

This is my repository for the unity component of the rui

The Dev Build folder contains the webgl build of Unity, with two index files. index is the normal index created by unity and index2 is a new version of index that uses a webcomponent script of the unity build

The Rui-webgl folder is the build folder contains the unity files

You can find documentation for converting the rui unity build into a webgl and passing data here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-6baaLyE0MY6KvbWC2plooeWwbhw0-VJgIhUYsEzmw/edit?pli=1#heading=h.dd15j7yg4xbg
